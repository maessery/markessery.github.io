### [NHL Salary Predictor](https://github.com/maessery/NHL-Salary-Predictor)
Using player production data from hockeyreference.com and contract data from capfriendly.com between 2007 and 2020, I explored what position(s) and stat categories are most correlated with higher pay, and predicted what a player's AAV would be based on their production on the ice. My final model used a combination of XGBoost Regression and Extra Trees Regressors and predicted a player's salary based on 72 features with 79% accuracy.

### Supplier Recommender
During my time in the 3PL industry, I created a .exe application with python to help sales reps find viable carriers for shipments. The user inputs a few basic filters, then receives back recommendations based on distance, a unique scoring system of 10 features, and a KNN algorithm.

### [Radio Signal Image Classification](https://github.com/maessery/SETI-Radio-Signal-Image-Classification)
Built a deep learning model from the Tensorflow library that was trained on 5600 spectogram images and classified them into 7 unique radio signal categories. The final model was comprised of a 15-layer CNN model and a Random Forest Classifier, and predicted with 87% accuracy. Data was based on the "SETI Data" Kaggle dataset.

### Effort Matrix
Created a performance analysis tool that measured salespersons against their peers. The graph's x-axis represents effort level based on engineered KPIs (greater effort from left to right) and output as the y-axis variable. Employees are then grouped into targeted developmental approaches according to their respective quadrant.
