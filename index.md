### [NHL Salary Predictor](https://github.com/maessery/NHL-Salary-Predictor)
Using player production data from hockeyreference.com and contract data from capfriendly.com between 2007 and 2020, I explored what position(s) and stat categories are most correlated with higher pay, and predicted what a player's AAV would be based on their production on the ice. My final model used a combination of XGBoost Regression and Extra Trees Regressors and predicted a player's salary based on 72 features with 79% accuracy.

### Supplier Recommender
During my time in the 3PL industry, I created a .exe application with python to help sales reps find viable carriers for shipments. The user inputs a few basic filters, then receives back recommendations based on distance, a unique scoring system of 10 features, and a KNN algorithm.
